**Library Application**

This library application provides users with an interface to perform operations such as listing books, adding books, and removing books. Below, you can find more information on how to use the application.

**User Guide:**

1. Press '1' to list the books in the library.
2. Press '2' to add a new book. Then, enter the details of the book, such as title, author, year of first release, and number of pages.
3. Press '3' to remove a book. Then, enter the title of the book you want to remove.
4. Press '4' to exit the application and terminate the program.

Please follow the instructions carefully at each step. The application will perform the respective operation based on the user's choice.

The application uses a text file named 'books.txt' as its storage location for added books and saved information. When the application is launched, it will automatically create this file if it doesn't exist or use the existing file if it is already present.

The application presents a user-friendly menu, and if you follow the options correctly, it will list books, add new books or remove existing books.
